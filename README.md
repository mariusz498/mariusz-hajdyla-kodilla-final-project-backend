Project is an attemp to make automatic shipping platform for suppliers and deliveres. At this point, creating supplier or deliverer profile works, as well as supplier view. 
In supplier view one can create new shipping order using location recognition, options of shipment, and change of currency.
Created orders are displayed in grid below. Grid is hidden if there are no orders.
A scheduler for cancelling order is implemented.

Future plan is to allow to edit or cancel an order and to make deliverers' interface to search and accept orders and confirming shipment.

Project should run without any preparation.
